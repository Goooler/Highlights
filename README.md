# Highlights
Kotlin Multiplatform syntax highlighting engine

## Installation
```sh
implementation("dev.snipme:highlights:0.4.0")
```

## Usage

> ðŸ’¡ As each Highlights instance caches code analysis, it is recommended to re-use the same instance for small code changes.

To start, simply put any code snippet in the default builder

```kotlin
Highlights.default().apply {
    setCode("public class ExampleClass {}")
    // Keywords = [public, class], Marks = [{, }]
    getCodeStructure()
    // BoldHighlight, ColorHighlight
    getHighlights()
}
```

You can also set language, theme and phrase emphasis. 
Language and theme has impact on the ColorHighlight and emphasis is represented by the BoldHighlight.

```kotlin
Highlights.Builder()
    .code("public class ExampleClass {}")
    .theme(SyntaxThemes.monokai())
    .language(SyntaxLanguage.JAVA)
    .emphasis(PhraseLocation(13, 25)) // ExampleClass
    .build()
    .run {
        getHighlights()
    }
```

More advance usage of this library is shown [here](/sample).
